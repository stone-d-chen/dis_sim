# Intro 

Over May 2011, a strain *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*) caused an outbreak of severe illness in Germany, with ~3,950 affected compared with ~200 cases a year typically seen. Of those infected 53 died.

In this - we extend a method presented by @held_two-component_2006 for modeling parameters of infectious disease counts in a Bayesian framework. Their method models the count data as a branching Poisson process with a cyclical endemic parameter. 

We then extend their model to incorporate a graph.

# Intro to Two-Component Model

@held_two-component_2006 presents a stochastic model for the statistical analysis of infectious disease counts that serves as the basis of the theextended graph model.

The two components of the model are a simple Poisson branching process with autoregressive parameter $\lambda$ and a seasonal component fit with a Fourier series. These components are described as the "epidemic" and "endemic" components respectively. Additionally, the two-component model allows for the $\lambda$ to change over time allowing for the disease to change infectivity over time.

## Two-Component Model Notation

Let $Z = (Z_0, Z_1, ..., Z_n)$ be the infectious disease counts at each time step $t$. The model is then specified through $Z_t | Z_{t-1}$.

Each $Z_t$ is determined as

$$ Z_t = Y_t + X_t,\ t\in\{1,\dots, n\}$$

Where $Y_t$ is the epidemic component and $X_t$ is the endemic component.
The epidemic component is parameterized as:
$$Y_t|Z_{t-1} \sim Pois(\lambda_tZ_{t-1})$$
Where $\lambda_t$  is piecewise constant depending on an unknown number of changepoints $K$ and unknown locations $\theta_1 < \cdots < \theta_K$.

$$ \lambda_t =  \begin{cases} \lambda^{(1)} & t < \theta_0 \\
\lambda^{(k)}, & \theta_{k} \leq t < \theta_{(k-1)} \\
\lambda^{(K+1)}, & t \geq \theta_K \end{cases}$$

The endemic component is parameterized as:

$$ X_t \sim Pois(\nu_t)$$

Where $\log{\nu_t}$ is modeled as a Fourier series:

$$ \log{\nu_t} = \gamma_0 + \sum_{l = 1}^L \big(\gamma_{2l-1}\sin(\rho l t)+\gamma_{2l}cos(\rho l t)\big) $$



## Epidemic Component

The epidemic component is given by:

$$Y_t|Z_{t-1} \sim Pois(\lambda_tZ_{t-1})$$

Where $\lambda_t$ is the time varing infectivity parameter and $Z_{t-1}$ is the the infected count in the previous time step.

We can think of $\lambda_t$ as the infectivity of the disease at time $t$ with an infected person causing new infections as $Pois(\lambda_t)$. Since each infected at time $Z_{t-1}$ generates new infected i.i.d $Pois(\lambda_t)$, then $Z_t$ is the sum of those random variables which itself is Poisson;  $\sum_1^{Z_{n-1}}Pois(\lambda_t) = Pois(\lambda_tZ_{n-1})$.

In this model, the $\lambda_t$ is allowed to vary over time. The parameter $\lambda = (\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_n)$ is a piecewise constant function with unknown number of changepoints $K$ and unknown location of changepoints $\theta_1 < \cdots < \theta_K$ with $\theta \in \{1,...,n-1\}$. If $K = 0$ there is no changepoint and the $\lambda$ parameter is constant throughout.

## TK add references below

For constant $\lambda$, this is known as a Poisson branching process. For such a process, when $\lambda > 1$ the process explodes and the number of infected goes to infinity with probability 1. When $\lambda < 1$ then the process "goes extinct" or reaches and remains at 0 with probability 1. Once the process reaches a point where $Z_t = 0$, it remains there as there are no more infected to create new infected at the next time step. When $\lambda_t > 1$ an "outbreak" occurs shown as the spike in the graph between. When $\lambda_t < 1$ the outbreak ends.

Allowing $\lambda_t$ to vary captures many scenarios, for example a particulary infectious strain of the flu could cause $\lambda_t$ to increase above 1 and cause an outbreak. Later, better or new vaccines and quarentine procedures can cause the overall infectivity to decrease below 1.


## Endemic Component

To prevent the branching proccess going extinct or going to infinity, the model includes an endemic component.


The endemic component is given by:

$$X_t \sim Pois(\nu_t)$$
$$\log{\nu_t} = \gamma_0 + \sum_{l = 1}^L (\gamma_{2l-1}\sin(\rho l t)+\gamma_{2l}cos(\rho l t))$$

That is, $\log{\nu_t}$ is fit with a Fourier series which can approximate any function arbitrarily closely. In @held_two-component_2006 they limit $L = 1$ since they determined higher order frequencies were insignificant.

The parameter can then be fit with a linear regression $\log{\nu_t} = s_t\gamma^T$

where $s_t = \langle 1, sin(\rho l t), \gamma_{2l}cos(\rho l t) \rangle$

# Actual Model

## Likelihood

$$P(Z|Z_0) = \prod_{t=1}^b P(Z_t|Z_t{-1})$$
Where

$$Z_t|Z_{t-1} \sim Pois(\nu_t + \lambda_tZ_{t-1})$$

$$\log{\nu_t} = \gamma_0 +  \gamma_{1}\sin(\rho l t)+\gamma_{2}\cos(\rho l t)$$

$$ \lambda_t =  \begin{cases} \lambda^{(1)} & t < \theta_0 \\
\lambda^{(k)}, & \theta_{k} \leq t < \theta_{(k-1)} \\
\lambda^{(K+1)}, & t \geq \theta_K \end{cases}$$


## Priors


$$P(K = k) \sim 1/n,\ k \in \{1,\dots,n\}$$
$$P(\theta|K=k) = \binom{n}{k}^{-1}$$

$$\gamma_i \sim N(0, 3I_3), i \in \{0,1,2\}$$ 


$$ \lambda^{(k)} \sim Gamma(1, 1),\ k \in \{1, \dots, K + 1\} $$

Then the full likelihood is

$$ P(Z_t|Z_{t-1},\theta, K, \lambda^{(1)}, \dots, \lambda^{(K+1)}, \gamma_0, \gamma_1, \gamma_2)*P(\theta|K)*P(K)*P(\prod_{k=1}^{k+1}\lambda^{(k)} )*P(\prod_{i=0}^2 \gamma_i)  $$

# Bayesian Inference


In Bayesian analysis, we aimt to calculate the posterior distribution of the parameters given the data via Bayes' theorem.

$$ P(\text{parameters}|\text{data}) = \frac{P(\text{data}|\text{parameters})P(\text{parameters})}{P(\text{data})} $$

One issue is the computation of $P(\text{data})$ which is given by $\int P(\text{data}|\text{parameters})P(\text{parameters})$ over the entire parameter space. With many parameters this integral it typically analytically intractable. To deal with this issue @held writes many of the distributions as conjugate priors etc (tk elaborate) and uses Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methods for some.

In this work we primarily appeal to MCMC methods.

## Markov chain Monte-Carlo

(tk terrible explanation)


A Markov Chain is a sequence of random variables $(X_n)$ where $P(X_n)$ depends only on $X_{n-1}$.

A probability distribution on the states of a Markov Chain is said to be a stationary distribution $\pi$ i

That is a distribution $\pi$ is a stationary distribution of the Markov Chain with transition probabilities $P$ if 

$$ \pi = \pi P $$

In Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), the algorithm generates samples from a given posterior dist $\pi$ by constructing a Markov chain with stationary distribution $\pi$

One method for constructing the chain is the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm


## Metropolis-Hastings Aglorithm

We start with a Markov Chain with proposal distribution $q(i,j)$.

We then modify $q$ in the following way to obtain a Markov Chain with stationary distribution $\pi$.

1. From the current state $X_n = i$ propose a new state $j$ according to $q$.
2. Compute the acceptance probability 

$$a(i,j) = \min{\big(\frac{\pi(j)q(j,i)}{\pi(i)q(i,j)},1\big) }$$

3. Generate $U \sim Unif(0,1)$
4. If $U < a_{ij}$ then accept the move and $X_n = j$ otherwise reject and $X_n = i$.

This new Markov Chain has a transition probability

$$p(i,j) = q(i,j)a(i,j)$$

Assuming $a(i,j) < 1$


$$ \begin{aligned} \int \pi(i)*p(i,j) & = \int\pi(j)*p(j,i) \\
\int \pi(i)q(i,j)\frac{\pi(j)q(j,i)}{\pi(i)q(i,j)} & = \int\pi(j)*q(j,i)*a(j,i) \\ \int \pi(j)*q(j,i)*1 & = \int\pi(j)*q(j,i)*a(j,i)
\end{aligned}$$


## Reversible Jump MCMC

To handle the dimension jumping of the model (between different number of changepoints) we use Reversible Jump MCMC.

Since the model can jump between a collection of possible models $\{M_k, k \in \{0,1,\cdots,n-1\}\}$ where $k$ indexes the number of possible changepoints.

The issue comes from the fact that we can only compare points in the parameter space if they're defined on the same probability space.

To properly do so we need to use a Reversible Jump MCMC.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Draw $u \sim Unif(0,1)$
2. The following proposals for the new $\lambda$ values are from 

$$\lambda*(\frac{u}{1-u})^{(\theta_1-\theta_0)/(\theta_2-\theta_0)}$$
$$\lambda*(\frac{1-u}{u})^{(\theta_2-\theta_1)/(\theta_2-\theta_0)}$$

That is the new $\lambda$ values are a compromise between the original value as a function of where the new changepoint is factored in.

3. Acceptance probability; In order to determine the acceptance probability for the proposal, the corresponding death move must also be determined.

This is done deterministically such that if the newly proposed changepoint is removed (and the heights were the same as newly proposed ones), then the new height should be the original height.

Then the new proposal probability would be

$$ \frac{p({K+1 \rightarrow K})*\frac{1}{K+1}}{p(K\rightarrow K+1)*\frac{1}{N-K}} $$
and the Jacobian is given by

$$(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2)^2/\lambda_0$$



`death_theta()` a Reversilbe Jump MCMC

# Implementation

## Proposals
Gamma, $\lambda$ are updated in respective blocks with a random walk metropolis.

The number of changepoints $K$ is updated by either randomly adding a new changepoint or by randomly deleting a current changepoint. This is done via a Reversible Jump MCMC


# graph notation

We now represent with 


$$X_{it}: \text{infected count in city } i \text{ at time step } t \text{, due to endemic factors}   $$
$$Y_{it} : \text{infected count in city } i \text{ at time step } t \text{, due to epidemic factors}   $$

$$Z_{i,t+1} = X_{i,t} + Y_{i,t}: \text{infected count in city } i \text{ at time step } t $$
We have:
$$X_{i,t} \sim Pois(\nu_t)$$

$$Y_{i,t}|G \sim ~ Pois\big(\lambda_t*\sum_{j=1}^nZ_{i,t}1[e_{i,j}=1]\big) $$

Where 

$$Y_{i,t} |G =   1[e_{1,i}]Z_{1,t-1} + 1[e_{2,i}]Z_{2,t-1} + \cdots + 1[e_{n,i}]Z_{1,t-1} | G  $$

$$P(G) \sim ERGM(\beta_0,\beta_1,...\beta_i)| \beta_0,\beta_1,...\beta_i$$

Where the $\beta_i$ are covariates assuming dyadic independence.

So the probability of $logit[P(G_{ij} = 1)] =  X^T\beta$
